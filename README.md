# Mini-Shell
A custom shell (msh) in C supporting command execution, environment variables, job control, and signal handling. It features a dynamic prompt (PS1), process management, special shell variables ($?, $$, $SHELL), and job control (fg, bg, jobs). Signal handling ensures Ctrl+C terminates only the foreground process, while Ctrl+Z suspends it.
